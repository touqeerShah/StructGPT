The dataset included 12 patients with hyperkalemia (Lab-K+ ≥ 5.5 mmol/L) and 11 \nhypokalemia (Lab-K+ ≤ 3.5 mmol/L).\nResults: The AI-ECG system demonstrated an AUC of >0.95 for predicting \nhyperkalemia and an AUC of 0.809 for hypokalemia. The correlation coefficient between \nECG-derived K+ levels (ECG-K+) and laboratory-measured K+ levels (Lab-K+) was 0.796, \nwith a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.456\nConclusions: Using this home-based ECG device, these results show that AI-ECG \npredict hyperkalemia better than hypokalemia and may be applied to future remote \ndetection or monitoring of hyperkalemia in high-risk patients. A further validation with \nlarger sample sizes is still required to confirm these findings.\nTH-OR23  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nAugmented Intelligence and Digital Health Advances\nAutomated Extraction of Kidney Failure Concepts from Clinical Notes \nUsing Artificial Intelligence\nLuke Harris,1 Samuele Buosi,2 Sarah Monahan,1 Finn Krewer,1,4 Mohan \nTimilsina,2 Niamh Corcoran,1 Nina Deacon,1 Michael Wrynn,1 Richard Farnan,1 \nDonal N. Reddan,1 George S. Mellotte,3 Peter J. Conlon,5 Conor S.

Unstructured data is challenging to use for audit, QI and research.\nMethods: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are a \ntransformer-based machine learning architecture useful for Natural Language Processing \n(NLP). Galway University Hospital data were extracted from KDCPMS, anonymised, \npre-processed, annotated as Diabetes-Y/N and IgA Nephropathy-Y/N by physicians using \nProdigy annotation software, and NLP model trained using a modified BERT algorithm \nrunning in HSE Integrated Information Services. We compared the NLP classification \nwith an algorithmic classification using ICD-10/EDTA codes, medication and HbA1c and \na retrospective chart review by physicians (gold standard).\nResults: 43314 patient notes were extracted. 10000 notes were annotated by \n5 physicians. Classification was performed on 33314 notes. 955 patients were classified \nas Diabetes-Y, 4190 as Diabetes-N, 269 as IgA Neph-Y and 2609 as IgA Neph-N. \n1744 patients were then classified algorithmically as Diabetes-Y and 214 patients were \nclassified algorithmically as IgA Neph-Y. For Diabetes, the NLP method achieved an \naccuracy of 79.0% (95% CI [77.4%,80.6%]), a sensitivity of 73.3% and specificity \nof 81.3%. Precision was 61.1%, F1 score 66.7% and macro F1 score 0.757. The \nalgorithmic method outperformed the NLP method with an accuracy of 98.1% (95%  \nCI [97.5%,98.6%]), sensitivity 96.7% and specificity 98.7%. Precision was 96.7%, \nF1 score 96.7% and macro F1 score 0.977. For IgA Nephropathy, the NLP method \ndemonstrated high accuracy of 96.2% (95% CI [95.1%,97.2%]), with sensitivity 83.3% \nand specificity 97.8%. Precision was 83.3%, F1 score 83.3% and macro F1 score 0.906. \nThe algorithmic method achieved perfect scores across all metrics, with accuracy, \nsensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and macro F1 score all at 100.0% (95%  \nCI [99.9%,100%]).\nConclusions: These results highlight the superior performance of the algorithmic \nmethod over the NLP method, particularly in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. However \nthe NLP method demonstrated substantial potential, especially for IgA Nephropathy.\nFunding: Government Support - Non-U.S.\nTH-OR24  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nAugmented Intelligence and Digital Health Advances\nImproving Dietary Choices Using a Digital Health Intervention in People \nwith CKD\nCourtney J. Lightfoot, Gurneet K. Sohansoha, Ella C. Ford, Noemi Vadaszy, \nThomas J. Wilkinson, Alice C. Smith, Matthew Graham-Brown. University of \nLeicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.\nBackground: We co-developed a digital health intervention (DHI) ‘My Kidneys \n& Me’ (MK&M) to support people with non-dialysis CKD to better self-manage health \nand lifestyle. MK&M includes theory-based educational and action (behaviour change) \nsessions about a healthy balanced diet, plus trackers for dietary goals. Here we report \nfindings on dietary behaviours from a multicentre randomised control trial of MK&M.\nMethods: 420 participants aged ≥18 years with CKD stages 3-4 were recruited from \n26 hospitals and randomised 2:1 to intervention (MK&M) (n=280) or control (n=140) \ngroups. The UK Diabetes Diet Questionnaire (UKDDQ) was collected at baseline and \n20-weeks via an online survey. The UKDDQ asks respondents how often they consumed \ncertain foods and drinks over the last month. Items are scored on the frequency of \nconsumption and classified into “healthy”, “less healthy” and “unhealthy” choices. \nAccess to and usage data of MK&M were collected. Linear regression models, adjusted \nfor baseline values, were conducted.\nResults: Of the 280 participants assigned to the intervention group, 225 (80%) \nused MK&M at least once. Over 20-weeks, the diet educational session was accessed \nby 107 (48%) participants and viewed 10.5 (±5.4) times for 11.0 (±15.0) minutes; the \ndiet action session was accessed by 77 (35%) participants and viewed 12.1 (±5.7) times \nfor 7.5 (±6.7) minutes. The healthy eating tracker was used by 32 (14%) participants.  \n30 (13%) participants set healthy eating goals (mean:1.6±1.2). At baseline, 44% \nMK&M (n=122) and 40% control (n=55) participants had a UKDDQ score in the \nhealthy range (≥4) (mean:3.3±0.4). At 20-weeks, the proportion with a UKDDQ in \nthe healthy range increased by 45% in MK&M group (44-64%, P<0.001) and 28% \nin control (40-51%, P<0.001). Significant between-group differences were observed \nfor changes in the number of healthy (±0.8, P=0.024) and less healthy dietary choices \n(±0.5, P=0.027), with MK&M group increasing the number of healthy food choices \n(+0.7, P=0.005) and decreasing the number of less healthy food choices (-0.6, \nP=0.009).\nConclusions: The use of MK&M DHI improved dietary food choices. People with \nCKD are interested in and actively engaged with DHIs to support healthy dietary habits. \nMK&M can be used to support people with CKD to improve their dietary behaviours.\nTH-OR25  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nAugmented Intelligence and Digital Health Advances\nEnhancing Nephrology with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Assisted ICD-10 \nCoding: Improving Health Care Reimbursement, Patient Care, Research, \nand Previsit Test Workflow Efficiency through Case Scenarios\nYasir Abdelgadir, Charat Thongprayoon, Jing Miao, Justin Pham, Supawadee \nSuppadungsuk, Iasmina Craici, Wisit Cheungpasitporn. Mayo Clinic Minnesota, \nRochester, MN.\nBackground: Accurate ICD-10 coding is crucial for healthcare reimbursement, \npatient care, and research. Inaccuracies in coding, can lead to issues with reimbursement, \ncompromised patient care and skewed research findings. These challenges stem from the \ncomplexity and time-consuming nature of coding tasks, burdening physicians. AI, such \nas ChatGPT, has the potential to improve accuracy and reduce workload. A recent study \nshowed that large language models (LLMs) performed poorly on medical code querying \ntasks. However, the assessment of AI-assisted ICD-10 coding in nephrology through case \nscenarios for pre-visit testing remains unexplored.\nMethods: This study involved 100 simulated cases covering various nephrology \nconditions. Two nephrologists created these cases to mirror typical nephrology diagnoses \nin inpatient and outpatient settings, incorporating case scenarios and pre-visit testing \ndata. The performance of ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0 was assessed by comparing  \nAI-generated ICD-10 codes against expected correct codes for each case. Assessments \nwere conducted in two trials, two weeks apart, in April 2024.\nResults: ChatGPT 3.5 reached an average accuracy of 89% over two trials, with a \nslight variation between them (91% in the first trial and 87% in the second). ChatGPT 4.0 \nshowed a consistent and higher accuracy of 99% in both trials. This indicates that 94% of \nthe AI-coded diagnoses correctly matched the expected ICD-10 codes. However, specific \nchallenges were noted with ChatGPT 3.5, particularly with repeated inaccuracies in \ndiagnosing conditions like Obstructive uropathy due to BPH and Acute Emphysematous \nPyelonephritis. ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated a more stable performance, with only one \nrepeated misdiagnosis (Bartter Syndrome) across the trials.\nConclusions: The findings suggest that AI, particularly ChatGPT 4.0, can significantly \nimprove the accuracy of ICD-10 coding in nephrology when provided with case scenarios \nand pre-visit testing data. This approach can enhance healthcare reimbursement, \npatient care, research, and pre-visit test nephrology workflow efficiency. However, the \nsmall percentage of errors highlights the need for ongoing review and improvement of  \nAI diagnostic systems.\nTH-OR26  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nAugmented Intelligence and Digital Health Advances\nUsing a Smartphone Camera at the Bedside to Detect and Quantify Residual \nBlood Clots in Single-Use Dialyzers with Paired-Image Classification\nHugo Y. Lin,1,2 Yi-Ren Yeh.3 1Kaohsiung Medical University Chung Ho \nMemorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; 2Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tun \nHospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; 3National Kaohsiung Normal University, \nKaohsiung, Taiwan.\nBackground: Blood clot formation and subsequent blockage of the capillary \nfibers of dialyzers is challenging for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on \nhemodialysis. This study aimed to develop a machine learning detection model that utilizes \nthe information obtained from dialyzer images to detect blood clots of dialyzers early.\nMethods: We gather dialyzer images captured at the bedside using mobile devices daily. \nInitially, we segment the image to extract the dialyzer part and filter out background noise \nunrelated to the residual blood clot analysis. Subsequently, we apply data augmentation to \nenhance robustness. Capturing snapshots at both ends of the dialyzer provides two distinct \nperspectives merged into a single composite image. Our classification task involves two \nclasses: instances with less than 10% residual blood clots (666 samples) and those with 30% \nresidual blood clots (538 samples). Due to the limited image dataset, we utilize a pre-trained \nimage classification model, EfficientNet, and fine-tune it using our collected data.",

Conducting ten random trials provided insights \ninto the model’s stability and consistency. The proposed model achieved an average \nrecognition rate of 76.33%, surpassing human evaluators who scored 62.71% and 60.05% \non the testing set. It demonstrates the model’s superior performance and potential to \nenhance recognition capabilities in relevant domains. The results prove the viability of \nemploying image-based approaches for detecting blood clots in dialyzers.\nConclusions: Our proposed framework, including data preprocessing and model \ntraining, exhibits potential for applications in various clinical scenarios where recognition \nrelies on information derived from images. This approach involves using image data to \namalgamate information from both ends of the dialyzer. By employing the EfficientNet \nmodel to detect blood clots, this integrated approach significantly improves blood clot \ndetection in dialyzers compared to human evaluators.\nFunding: Government Support - Non-U.S.\nTH-OR27  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nAugmented Intelligence and Digital Health Advances\nPerformance and Global Integration in Clinical Practice of a Fistula \nFailure Risk-Estimate Tool Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nJasmine Ion Titapiccolo,1 Milind Nikam,2 Stefano Stuard,3 Jeffrey L. Hymes,4 \nJohn W. Larkin,4 Suman K. Lama,4 Sheetal Chaudhuri,4 Francesco Bellocchio,1 \nJulianna Yeung,2 Len A. Usvyat,4 Luca Neri.1 1Fresenius Medical Care AG, \nVaiano Cremasco, Italy; 2Fresenius Medical Care AG, Singapore, Singapore; \n3Fresenius Medical Care AG, Bad Homburg, Germany; 4Fresenius Medical \nCare AG, Boston, MA.\nBackground: Accurate prediction of fistula failure risk (FFR) in hemodialysis \npatients is critical for timely intervention and improved clinical outcomes. This study \nevaluates the performance of an AI-based FFR estimate tool in clinical practice. The data, \ncollected over 12 months (February 2023-January 2024), encompass multiple countries, \nhighlighting variations in clinical outcomes.\nMethods: Data were collected from hemodialysis centers in seven countries \n(Australia, Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain), totaling \n83,126 records. The AI risk estimation tool is integrated in the clinical system EuCliD® \n(Fresenius Medical Care) and provides nephrologists with a monthly estimate of FFR \nover the next 90 days. Predictive accuracy in comparison with actual failure incidence \nwas assess using AUC of ROC curve. Fistula failures include angioplasty (with/without \nstent), thrombectomy, switch to a new dialysis access, temporarily unusable fistula, and \nhospitalization due to fistula complication.\nResults: The AI tool exhibited a varied performance across countries, with the \nglobal AUC being 78.1%. The global failure incidence percentage was 6.2%. Failure \npercentages for each of the four considered categories are reported in Table 1. Differences \nin the habit of reporting data in the clinical system can be highlighted from the table. Risk \nmetrics also varied across countries.\nConclusions: The AI-based FFR estimate tool demonstrated robust predictive \nperformance across diverse clinical settings. The depicted variability shows the \nimportance of localized adaptation of AI tools.\nFunding: Commercial Support - Fresenius Medical Care, Private Foundation Support\nTable 1.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham \nHeersink School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL.\nBackground: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is a bone-derived hormone that \ntargets the kidney via FGF receptor (FGFR) isoform 1c and klotho and increases phosphate \nexcretion. In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients, renal FGF23-responsiveness is \nimpaired, leading to high serum FGF23 levels that clinical studies have shown to be \nassociated with cardiac hypertrophy and cardiovascular mortality. In previous studies we \nfound that elevated FGF23 can directly target cardiac myocytes and activate FGFR4 in a \nklotho-independent manner, resulting in hypertrophic cell growth. Surprisingly, we also \nfound that unfractionated heparin (UFH) increases the FGF23:FGFR4 binding affinity \nand when injected into mice with elevated FGF23 levels aggravates cardiac hypertrophy. \nHeparin exists in different variants with a large range of structures and charges. In \nthis study, we investigate whether heparin variants differ in their ability to modulate \nFGF23:FGFR4 binding.\nMethods: FGF23:FGFR4 binding affinity was analyzed using our plate-based \nbinding assay. 96-well plates were coated with recombinant FGF23 protein and \nsequentially incubated with heparin variants, Fc-tagged FGFR4, horse radish peroxidase \n(HRP)-coupled anti-Fc antibody, and HRP substrate. Reactions were analyzed using a \nplate reader at 450 nm wavelength. All samples were run in triplicates.\nResults: FGF23:FGFR4 binding affinity was increased by large UFHs, including \ndialysis UFH, and by low-molecular heparins. In contrast, smaller heparin variants, \nlike the pentasaccharide fondaparinux sodium, did not increase FGF23:FGFR4 binding. \nDesulfated heparins only had a minor impact on FGF23:FGFR4 binding.\nConclusions: Our study indicates that the ability of heparin to mediate FGF23:FGFR4 \nbinding depends on its length and negative charges. Small and uncharged heparin variants \ndo not increase FGF23:FGFR4 binding affinity. Next, we will test the effects of heparin \nvariants on FGF23-induced cardiac hypertrophy in cell culture and animal models. Most \npatients with end-stage kidney disease undergo hemodialysis, during which UFH is \ncommonly administered as an anticoagulant. Since hemodialysis does not lower serum \nFGF23 levels, we postulate that frequent UFH infusions contribute to cardiac injury and \nhigh mortality rates and that replacing UFH with small-chain heparin variants might \nextend the lifespan of hemodialysis patients.\nFunding: NIDDK Support, Private Foundation Support\nTH-OR29  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nAssociation of the Ratio of Intact-to-C-terminal Fibroblast Growth \nFactor 23 with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction\nCassianne Robinson-Cohen,1 Farzana Perwad,2 Joachim H. Ix,4 Valentin David,3 \nElvis A. Akwo.1 1Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN; 2University  \nof California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; 3Northwestern University \nFeinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL; 4University of California San Diego,  \nLa Jolla, CA.\nBackground: Previous studies report an association between high levels of circulating \nfibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and the risk of heart failure with preserved ejection \nfraction (HFpEF) particularly in chronic kideney disease (CKD). One such mechanism for \nFGF23 elevation is decreased proteolytic cleavage marked by increased circulating intact-\nto-C-terminal FGF23 ratio (iFGF23:cFGF23). The aim of this study was to investigate the \nassociation between the iFGF23:cFGF23 ratio and the risk of HFpEF using a two-sample \nMendelian Randomization (MR) approach.\nMethods: Genetic instruments were independent significant single nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNPs) from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of iFGF23:cFGF23 \nratio in 745 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Summary-level data for \nHFpEF were from a GWAS conducted among 17,030 participants in Vanderbilt’s DNA \nBiobank (BioVU). The main analysis was conducted using the random-effects inverse \nvariance weighted (IVW) estimator. Sensitivity analyses used the weighted median and \nMR-Egger methods. Analyses were performed separately in individuals of European and \nAfrican ancestry and then meta-analyzed.\nResults: In the transethnic meta-analysis, genetically predicted higher values of \nthe iFGF23:cFGF23 ratio were associated with greater odds of HFpEF (OR=1.07, 95% \nCI: 1.02-1.12, p=0.007). The MR estimate was consistent in models adjusted for eGFR \n(OR=1.06, 95%CI: 1.02-1.12, p=0.02) and across statistical approaches (weighted median \nand MR-Egger). The p-value for the MR-Egger intercept test was consistently greater \nthan 0.05 across analytic subgroups suggesting no evidence of directional pleiotropy.\nConclusions: This MR suggests that higher values of iFGF23:cFGF23 – a marker of \ndecreased FGF23 cleavage – is associated with greater risk of HFpEF. Additional work \ninto the mechanisms of FGF23 elevation in CKD and its relationship with heart failure \nis needed.\nFunding: NIDDK Support",
  "CKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nKey: TH - Thursday; FR - Friday; SA - Saturday; OR - Oral; PO - Poster; PUB - Publication Only\nUnderline represents presenting author.\n10\nJ Am Soc Nephrol 35: 2024\nOral Abstract/Thursday\nTH-OR30  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nInvolvement of COMMD5 in Vascular Calcification in CKD\nZewen Zhao, Shuangxin Liu. Guangdong Provincial People’s Hospital, \nGuangzhou, China.\nBackground: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent and recurring health \ncondition affecting a significant number of individuals. Among CKD patients, approximately \n2-3% progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Vascular calcification emerges as a \nprevalent complication in ESRD cases and has a strong correlation with the incidence \nof cardiovascular events. The disruption of calcium and phosphorus metabolism stands \nout as a primary factor contributing to vascular calcification. Recently, the hypertension-\nassociated calcium regulatory gene (HCaRG) unveiled a connection with COMM domain-\ncontaining 5 (COMMD5). Identified as a gene influenced by extracellular calcium levels, \nCOMMD5 encodes a compact intracellular protein composed of 225 amino acids. Past \nresearch suggests that parathyroidectomy (PTX) can reduce vascular calcification, and \nincreased levels of COMMD5 are associated with decreased blood pressure. Nevertheless, \nthe literature lacks substantial reports on the relationship between COMMD5 and vascular \ncalcification. Our hypothesis ventures that COMMD5 could indeed be intricately linked to \nchronic vascular calcification.\nMethods: The blood vessels of the arteriovenous fistula are tested for calcification \nand COMMD5 expression. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) and rat aortas \nwere cultured in vitro and incubated with high phosphorus.\nResults: (1)COMMD5 expression is reduced in arteriovenous fistula vascular calcified \ntissues.(2)In comparison to the control group, the expression of COMMD5 in HASMC \nexhibited lower levels under high phosphorus stimulation.(3)HASMCs were subjected to \nstimulation using small interfering RNA (siRNA). This led to an upregulation of Runt-\nrelated transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression and downregulation of Anti-Smooth \nMuscle Antibody (α-SMA) expression in the cells.(4)Rat aortas were cultured in vitro and \nincubated with high phosphorus to stimulate isolated arteries. Upon conducting alizarin \nred staining, the group incubated with COMMD5 under high phosphorus stimulation \ndisplayed reduced levels of calcification in comparison to the high phosphorus group.\nConclusions: COMMD5 plays a crucial role in inhibiting calcification in human aortic \nsmooth muscle cells, consequently contributing to the reduction of vascular calcification.\nFunding: Government Support - Non-U.S.\nTH-OR31  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nSpatial Detection and Consequences of Nonkidney Calcitriol Production \nas Assessed by Targeted Mass Spectrometry Imaging\nMark B. Meyer,1 Seong Min Lee,1 Shannon R. Cichanski,1 Diego F. Cobice,3 \nJ. W. Pike.2 1University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Nutritional \nSciences, Madison, WI; 2University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of \nBiochemistry, Madison, WI; 3Ulster University, Coleraine, United Kingdom.\nBackground: The benefits of vitamin D supplementation beyond calcium and \nphosphate maintenance in humans are highly clinically debated. Kidney expression \nof CYP27B1 is the source of endocrine 1,25(OH)2D3 (active form of vitamin D) that \nmaintains serum calcium and phosphate. 1,25(OH)2D3 may also be made by the CYP27B1 \nenzyme in non-renal cells, like immune cells, in a process driven by cellular availability of \nprecursor 25(OH)D3 and inflammation. Due to the endocrine nature of renally produced \n1,25(OH)2D3 in circulation, it is difficult to discern between these two sources.\nMethods: We have recently created a regulatory deletion model of Cyp27b1  \n(M1/M21-DIKO) where the mice have normal inflammatory-regulated Cyp27b1 \nexpression in non-renal tissues (unlike global Cyp27b1-KO), but no expression within \nthe kidney. Using these unique M1/M21-DIKO mice, we hypothesized that vitamin D \nsupplementation will increase 25(OH)D3 circulation and tissue availability, and therefore \nincrease the production of 1,25(OH)2D3 in non-renal tissues. Utilizing on-tissue chemical \nderivatization (OTCD) and targeted Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-\nMass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI), we investigated the tissue distribution of \n1,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 in the M1/M21-DIKO mice compared to Cyp27b1-KO mice \nand wildtype littermates after PBS perfusion in the kidney, liver, spleen, and thymus.\nResults: MALDI-MSI demonstrated that the levels of 25(OH)D3 were greatly affected \nby vitamin D supplementation and increased in all tissues examined. We confirmed that \nthe M1/M21-DIKO mouse, like the Cyp27b1-KO mouse, had no kidney production of \n1,25(OH)2D3 even in the animals with high levels of supplementation. However, we saw \nincreased production of 1,25(OH)2D3 in tissues outside of the kidney such as the spleen \nin the M1/M21-DIKO mouse. Gene expression found increased Il4 and decreased Tnfa \nin the spleen indicating an initiation of an anti-inflammatory program as observed with \nvitamin D in immune cells ex vivo.\nConclusions: Taken together, these data verify, visualize, and quantify, for the first \ntime, non-renal production of 1,25(OH)2D3 in vivo, provide a consequence of non-renal \n1,25(OH)2D3 production in cytokine changes, and offer a benefit to elevated vitamin D \nsupplementation in potential positive outcomes for inflammatory disease.\nFunding: NIDDK Support, Other NIH Support - NHLBI - HL159645\nTH-OR32  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nBone Sialoprotein Regulates Phosphate Metabolism and Reduces \nHyperparathyroidism in Mice with CKD\nMarie-Helene Lafage-Proust,1,2 Lauriane Hivert,1 Christophe O. Soulage,3,4 \nLaurent Beck,5,6 Luc Malaval.1 Sainbiose Lab. 1Université J Monnet, Inserm \nU1059, Saint-Etienne, France; 2Chu Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France; \n3Université Lyon 1, Lyon, France; 4INSA, Lyon, France; 5UMR_S 1087 / \nUMR_C 6291 l’Unité de Recherche de l’Institut du Thorax, Nantes, France; \n6Nantes Universite, Nantes, France.\nBackground: Bone Sialoprotein (BSP), Osteopontin (OPN), DMP1 and MEPE, \nregulate bone mineralization and are closely co-regulated. While DMP1 and MEPE \nare known to impact phosphate (Pi) metabolism, we hypothesized that BSP might also \ninfluence body Pi handling.\nMethods: Nine-week-old (WT) and BSP knockout (KO) mice fed a normal Pi diet \n(0.55% Pi, ND). We collected 24h urine, feces, blood, femur, kidneys and gut samples for \nbiochemical and molecular analyses.\nResults: WT and KO had normal Pi and FGF23 serum levels (s) but KO were \nhypophosphaturic (-75% vs WT). KO expressed lower NaPi2c renal transporter mRNA \nlevels (p<0.006 vs WT) while NPT2b and Pit1/2 gut expression were similar to WT. We \nsuspected impaired paracellular Pi gut absorption, a key pathway under ND. Indeed, KO \nexhibited significant higher water (200%), K+ (50%), Na+ and Pi levels in feces (p<0.01 vs \nWT). Multiplex gene expression analysis of gut revealed differential regulation of genes \nrelated to matrix remodeling, including higher DMP1, confirmed by RT-PCR (x10 in KO \nvs WT), BSP and MEPE mRNAs being undetectable. As Chronic kidney disease (CKD) \nraises systemic Pi load, increasing cardiovascular mortality, we hypothesized that lack \nof BSP could mitigate CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorders (CKD-MBD) by reducing Pi \nintestinal absorption. We performed 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) or sham surgery on 20-wk-old \nWT and KO mice. After 3 months of CKD, both genotypes showed higher ureamia \ncompared to their sham controls. However, FGF23 (s) rose less in Nx-KO compared to \nNx-WT (p<0.05) while serum Pi remained normal. Fractional urine Pi excretion increased \nin both genotypes but remained twice lower in Nx-KO than in Nx-WT (p<0.05). After \n3 months of high Pi diet (1.65% Pi, HP), Nx-KO were neither hypophosphaturic nor \nhad lower FGF23 (s) compared to Nx-WT. In addition, KO displayed higher PTH serum \nlevels (x1.5) and cortical porosity (µCT) compared to Nx-WT.\nConclusions: Deletion of BSP, a bone-specific protein, decreased gut paracellular Pi \nabsorption, possibly involving DMP1, known to regulate Blood Brain Barrier permeability. \nIn CKD and under ND, the blunting of FGF23 increase in KO suggests an adverse role of \nBSP in Pi homeostasis, while, under HP, BSP might protect against CKD-MBD by reducing \nsecondary hyperparathyroidism and its harmful effects on cortical bone.\nFunding: Commercial Support - KIOWA-KRIRIN\nTH-OR33  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nExercise Mimetic Restores Muscle and Bone Outcomes in a Rat Model  \nof CKD\nAshley D. Troutman,1 Neal X. Chen,2 Shruthi Srinivasan,2 Corinne E. Metzger,2 \nKalisha O’Neill,2 Landon Tak,2 Michael Schulte,2 Sharon M. Moe,2 Keith G. \nAvin.2,1 1Indiana University, Department of Physical Therapy, Indianapolis, IN; \n2Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.\nBackground: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progressively deteriorates skeletal \nmuscle and bone leading to sarcopenia and CKD-bone mineral disease (CKD-MBD). \nExercise studies have demonstrated variable success, which supports the need for \npharmacological interventions. We used an investigational drug, Locamidazole (LAMZ), \nwith documented muscle and bone anabolic effects that mimic exercise. We hypothesized \nthat LAMZ would improve physical function and bone outcomes in a rat model of CKD.\nMethods: We used a naturally occurring and progressive rat model of CKD \n(Cy/+; n=10-12/gr): 1) normal littermates (NL), 2) Cy/+ (CKD), and 3) CKD-LAMZ \n(LAMZ). LAMZ s.q. injections, 2x/day at 0.625mg/kg for 5 weeks, beginning at  \n27 weeks (CKD stage 3). At 33 weeks (end-stage renal disease), rats were terminated \nfor specimen collection. Outcomes: serum biochemistry, electrically stimulated muscle \nstrength and fatigue (series of 50 muscle contractions), maximal running distance, bone \nmicroarchitecture, and vascular calcification. Data analysis included one-way ANOVA \nwith Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.\nResults: Disease Effects (CKD vs NL)- CKD was confirmed via elevated blood urea \nnitrogen (BUN; p<0.0001) and creatinine (p<0.0001), muscle weakness (p<0.05), muscle \nfatigue (p<0.01), lower running distance (p<0.05), increased cortical bone porosity \n(p<0.001), and reduced cortical bone area (p<0.01), and cortical thickness (p<0.001). \nLAMZ Effects (CKD-LAMZ vs CKD)- LAMZ did not impact disease progression. \nLAMZ improved muscle function with significantly improved maximally stimulated \nmuscle strength (p<0.05) and trending improvements for electrically stimulated muscle \nfatigue (p=0.08). LAMZ improved bone health with reduced cortical porosity (p<0.01) \nand increased cortical thickness (p<0.01). Maximal running distance demonstrated \nan intermediate level of adaptation (i.e., not statistically different from NL or CKD); \nadditional samples pending for biochemistry and vascular calcification.",

Prior \nwork suggests that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) identify low vs non-low cortical \nBT in CKD. We aimed to assess whether 19 miRNAs discriminate BT and biopsy proven \ncontraindications (CI) to antiresorptive therapies (ART) in CKD patients.\nMethods: Single-site cross-sectional study. Patients with stage 4-5 CKD having a high \nfracture risk underwent iliac crest bone biopsy for assessment of BT and mineralization \nlevels according to ASBMR guidelines. Absolute CI to ART were defined by the presence \nof adynamic bone disease or osteomalacia. Relative CI were defined by the presence of \nmineralization defects without osteomalacia and low BT without adynamic bone. At the \ntime of the biopsy, blood test were drawn for assessment of mineral biochemistry as per \nlocal standard and for measurement of 19 circulating miRNAs using the osteomiR kit \n(TAmiRNA, Austria). Each miRNA was compared between low vs high/normal BT, low/\nnormal vs high BT, patients with absolute CI vs relative or no-CI to ART. Diagnostic \naccuracy was tested using the median and lowest tertile of each miRNA.\nResults: Fourty four patients were included (women 56.8%, mean age 69.6±9.2, \n45.4% dialysis). 19 had low BT, 16 normal, and 9 high BT; 7 patients had absolute  \nCI to ART (2 osteomalacia, 5 adynamic bone). miRNA levels did not differ between \nlow and normal/high BT groups. However, miRNA-31-5p was higher in patients with \nhigh BT (p=0,02), a value above the lowest tertile being associated with high BT \nstatus (sensitivity 100%, specificity 57,1% (95%CI: 40,8-73,5%), negative predicted \nvalue (NPV) 100%). We found 7 miRNAs (let7b5p, miRNA-141-3p, 143-3p, 17-5p,  \n19b-3p, 29b-3p, 550a-3p) with a very good capability to rule out CI to ART. A value above \nthe median being associated with absolute CI to ART (sensitivity 85,7% (95%CI: 59, \n8-100%), specificity<60%, NPV 95.5% (95%CI: 86.8-100%)). A value above the lowest \ntertile was even more discriminant (NPV 100% for 5/7).\nConclusions: Circulating miRNAs can help clinical decision in the approach of bone \nfragility in CKD. Large studies in heterogeneous cohorts are needed to validate these \nresults.\nTH-OR35  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nReliability of Time-Lapse High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative CT \n(HR-pQCT) in Determining Bone Remodeling in Patients with ESKD\nMinhao Zhou,1 Saghi Sadoughi,1 Lauren Go,1 Isabel Yu,2 Po-hung Wu,1 \nIsra Saeed,1 Bo Fan,1 Isidro B. Salusky,3 Thomas Nickolas,4 Joachim H. Ix,5 \nGalateia J. Kazakia.1 1University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; \n2University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA; 3University of California \nLos Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA; 4Columbia  \nUniversity Irving Medical Center, New York, NY; 5University of California \nSan Diego Department of Medicine, La Jolla, CA.\nBackground: Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have elevated fracture \nrisk in part due to abnormally high or low bone turnover, requiring treatment from patient-\nspecific turnover assessments. However, a reliable, accessible, and non-invasive tool \nto determine turnover in individual patients does not exist. High-resolution peripheral \nquantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) captures high-resolution in vivo bone \nmicrostructure. Time-lapse (TL) analysis uses longitudinal spatially-aligned HR-pQCT \nscans to evaluate temporospatial bone remodeling (FigA). This work evaluates the \nfeasibility of TL HR-pQCT to assess turnover in patients with ESKD. We hypothesized \nthat a 2-month TL period could capture remodeling in ESKD.\nMethods: Distal tibia and radius scans were acquired on XtremeCT II. Bone \nformation and resorption fraction (BFF and BRF) were evaluated with respect to baseline \nintegral, cortical, and trabecular bone volumes. Total and net bone turnover (TBT and \nNBT) were calculated as BFF+BRF and BFF-BRF, respectively (FigB). All rates were \nannualized (%/year). Annualized least significant change (LSC) in remodeling was \nestablished from a cohort of 15 healthy participants scanned twice ~1 year apart.\nResults: Eight patients with ESKD on dialysis underwent 2 scans ~2 months apart \n(mean months on dialysis: 46; FigC). TL analysis showed that BFF and BRF in the ESKD \ncohort were >2- and >6-fold higher than the respective LSC (FigD-E). Radius cortical \nbone loss of 10.6%/year was found in ESKD (FigE).\nConclusions: This study showed that individual bone remodeling in ESKD can be \ncaptured by TL HR-pQCT in a 2-month TL period, shorter than that needed for gold \nstandard tetracycline double-labeled bone biopsy. The assessed trabecular BFF in ESKD \n(9.6-21.3%/year) agrees with reported histomorphometric formation (3.5-22.4%/year), \nand the observed cortical bone loss aligns with known ESKD pathology, both verifying \nthe reliability of TL HR-pQCT in ESKD bone turnover assessments. Future work will \nfurther validate TL HR-pQCT.\nTH-OR36  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD-MBD and Kidney Stones: Novel Insights\nAcute Effect of High Fat Intake on Urinary Acidification Parameters \nin Uric Acid Stone Formers and Non-stone Forming Controls\nAlireza Zomorodian, Xilong Li, Naim M. Maalouf, Orson W. Moe, \nKhashayar Sakhaee. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, \nDallas, TX.\nBackground: The prevalence of uric acid nephrolithiasis (UAN) has increased \ncontemporaneously with obesity and metabolic syndrome in recent decades. The \nkey pathogenic factor in UAN is acidic urine pH (< 5.5), which results from reduced \nbuffering of H+ by ammonia (NH3 + H+ → NH4\n+). Ammoniagenesis by the renal proximal \ntubule (PT) consumes amino acids and generates ATP. In this study, we tested whether \nprovision of free fatty acid (FFA) as an alternative energy (ATP) precursor impairs renal \nammoniagenesis in uric acid stone formers (UASF) and controls (Ctrl) by substrate \ncompetition.\nMethods: Seven UASF and eight BMI-matched Ctrl were equilibrated on a fixed \nmetabolic diet for 4 days. After sampling fasting urine and blood, subjects received an \noral fat load (heavy cream 0.50 ml/kg body weight) hourly for 10 hours. Blood and urine \nsamples were collected every 2 hours during this period. Outcomes: urine acid-base \nparameters and blood FFA and ketone bodies (KB).\nResults: Both groups showed significant and similar increases in serum FFA and \nKB following the fat load. Urine pH (UpH) progressively decreased from 6.6 to 5.6 in \nthe Ctrl group over the 10-hour period (p < 0.001), while UpH started lower (5.3) in the \nUASF group and remained unchanged over 10 hrs (p=0.59). While the fraction of net \nacid excretion (NAE) in the form of ammonium (NH4\n+) (NH4\n+/NAE) was notably lower \nin fasting urine in the UASF group compared to Ctrl (p = 0.002), this ratio significantly \ndecreased in both groups during the 10-hour fat load (Ctrl: p < 0.001; UASF: p = 0.01).\nConclusions: Acute elevation in serum FFA by an oral fat load leads to a reduction \nin urine pH and NH4\n+/NAE in Ctrl, to levels comparable to UASF. These findings are \ncompatible with a substrate switch, whereby high FFA provision in UASF reduces amino \nacid metabolism and nitrogen provision for ammoniagenesis, resulting in aciduria and \npredisposition to UAN.\nFunding: NIDDK Support, Private Foundation Support\nTH-OR37  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD: Novel Risk Factors and Consequences\nPredictors of the Plasma and Fecal Metabolomes in CKD: The CRIC \nGut Study\nAmanda H. Anderson,1 Robin L. Baudier,2 Shuo Bai,3 Hongzhe Li,4 Gary Wu.4 \nThe CRIC Study. 1The University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public \nHealth, Birmingham, AL; 2Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR; \n3Tulane University, New Orleans, LA; 4University of Pennsylvania Perelman \nSchool of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.\nBackground: The importance of kidney function and gut microbiota relative to other \nclinical and behavioral factors in predicting the plasma and fecal metabolomes is unclear \nin CKD.\nMethods: Among N=291 adults in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) \nGut Study, we used random forest models to determine relative predictive power of \nclinical factors, kidney measures, diet, environmental factors, gut microbiota, and \nthe fecal metabolome in explaining the plasma and fecal metabolomes and individual \nmetabolite levels in CKD.",

However, its association with new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD)\nand its performance in comparison to some conventional dietary patterns, including\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Alternate Mediterranean diet (aMed),\nAlternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), and healthful Plant-Based Diet Index\n(hPDI) remain unclear.\n**Methods: 179,569 participants without CKD and with complete dietary data at**\nbaseline from the UK Biobank were included. The PURE score was calculated based\non six foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, fish, and dairy), ranging from 6 to 30.\nThe study outcome was new-onset CKD.\n**Results: During a median follow-up of 12.1 years, 4,822 participants developed**\nCKD. The PURE score was inversely associated with new-onset CKD (per 1 quintile\nincrement: HR, 0.92; 95%CI,0.90-0.94).

Reverse Mendelian randomization tested the opposite \ndirection: if genetically predicted kidney function was associated with mtDNA-CN.\nResults: In the UK Biobank, we observed a 12% higher risk of incident AKI (hazard \nratio (HR)=0.88, 95% CI = 0.86–0.91, P=2.4x10-6) and 8% increased odds of incident \nCKD (odds ratio=0.92, 95% CI = 0.89-0.94, P=0.0008) per 1 standard deviation (SD) \ndecrease in mtDNA-CN while adjusting for baseline eGFR.

However, \nevaluations of causal inference and prognostic utility beyond traditional biomarkers are \nlacking.\nMethods: TKV of 34,595 White British ancestry participants were derived from \nthe UK Biobank. Association with incident CKD were assessed with Cox proportional \nhazard models. Prognostic thresholds for CKD risk stratification were identified using a \nmodified Mazumdar method with bootstrap resampling. Overall improvement in model \nperformance was assessed using likelihood ratio test. Risk reclassification was evaluated \nwith 5-fold cross-validation. Bidirectional associations of genetically predicted TKV with \nkidney traits were assessed using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).\nResults: Adjusted for eGFR and albuminuria, a lower TKV of 10 mL was associated \nwith a 6% higher risk of incident CKD (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.08, P = 5.8 x 10-6). \nIndividuals below the prognostic threshold of body surface area adjusted TKV \n(BSA-TKV) at 119 mL/m2 (10th percentile) exhibited 2.8-fold (95% CI 2.03 to 3.85,  \nP = 2.9 x 10-10) higher risk of incident CKD after accounting for eGFR, albuminuria, and \ntraditional risk factors. Addition of BSA-TKV improved model performance of the CKD \nPrognosis Consortium Incident CKD Risk Score (likelihood ratio P = 4.8 x 10-14) and \nimproved reclassification of high-risk prognostication at a rate of 1 per 3.3 cases (95%  \nCI 3.1 to 3.6).

However, such factors have not been well studied. We \naimed to identify urinary metabolites modifying the risk of APOL1 associated CKD \nprogression in AA patients of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC).\nMethods: By using an untargeted approach, we measured 1,350 metabolites from \n24-hour urine samples collected at baseline for all 1,513 AA participants of the CRIC. \nCKD progression was defined as the onset of end-stage renal disease or a 50% reduction \nin estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during 20 years’ follow-up. We tested \ninteractions of each metabolite with APOL1 risk variants on CKD progression using \nCox proportional hazard models adjusting for age, sex, study site, smoking, drinking, \nbody mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, urine protein \ncreatinine ratio, and eGFR. Metabolites with a false discovery rate corrected q <0.05 were \ndeemed significant. Genome-wide analyses were performed for significant metabolites to \nidentify genes associated with them.\nResults: Two metabolites, decadienedioic acid (C10:2-DC) and X_24728, \nsignificantly modified the effect of APOL1 risk variants on CKD progression (Figure). \nThe APOL1 variants only increased risk for CKD progression among those with \nhigher than median of C10:2-DC (hazard ratio [HR]= 1.63, 95% confidence interval \n[CI]: 1.24-2.16) but not among those with less than the median (HR=0.85; 95%  \nCI: 0.62-1,16).

NYU Langone Health, New York, NY.\nBackground: Reducing symptoms is essential to improving quality of life in CKD. \nKSC can achieve this, and can be used for all treatment modalities, including conservative \nkidney management (CKM). However, KSC is not widely available in the US, and its \nimpact is not well described.\nMethods: Patients completed the IPOS-Renal, a CKD symptom survey for which \nhigher scores represent greater burden, at each visit to our KSC clinic between May 2016 \nand December 2023.\nResults: 189 patients were followed for a mean of 5 months (range 0-58), with a mean \nof 3 surveys/patient. 69 (37%) were on dialysis, 42 (23%) had chosen CKM, the remainder \nwere deciding (26%), planning for dialysis (5%), or without advanced CKD  (9%). \nCompared to dialysis patients, CKM patients were older (84 vs. 64 years), more likely \nto be White (69% vs. 39%), non-Hispanic (74% vs. 58%), and have a higher Charlson \ncomorbidity score (10 vs. 6). Mean GFR of CKM patients was 12  mL/min/1.73m2. \nCKM patients had a lower initial symptom burden than dialysis patients (21 vs. 29), and \nthis was maintained over time (Figure 1). Both groups had an initial decrease in their \nsymptoms, however, KSC was more effective at sustaining this response in CKM. Linear \nmixed models assessing longitudinal change over 58 months showed that IPOS renal \nscores were 7.7 points higher in dialysis patients than in those on CKM (p=0.03), after \nadjusting for comorbidities.\nConclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first US data showing that KSC appears \nto be an effective at reducing CKD symptoms. The benefits appear to be more sustained \nin patients who had chosen CKM.

Conservative kidney management (CKM) is \nincreasingly accepted for older CKD patients. This study aims to examine CKM status \nand related factors in aging Japanese society.\nMethods: This cohort study used health screening and medical claims data from \nApril 2014 to May 2023. We included people aged 75 or older with advanced kidney \ndisease (eGFR<8), observed for at least one year and not receiving maintenance dialysis \nat inclusion. The population was divided into two groups: planned initiation of dialysis \n(non-CKM group) and selected for CKM (CKM group). A Cox proportional hazards \nmodel with age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and frailty categorized by Electronic \nFrailty Index assessed factors impacting CKM selection. All-cause mortality and total \nhospitalizations were also examined in both groups.\nResults: A total of 480 were included in this analysis (median [IQR] age, 81.1 \n[77.9-84.8] years; 247 women [51.5%]). Of these, 359 (74.8%) did not undergo necessary \npractice for dialysis and were defined as choosing CKM. Cox regression showed no \nsignificant differences in age, sex, or BMI between the groups. By contrast, the non-frail \ngroup was significantly less likely to initiate dialysis compared to the severe-frail group \n(HR 0.11 [95% CI, 0.02-0.82]). Cox regression analysis of all-cause mortality showed no \nsignificant difference between the groups (HR 1.25 [95% CI, 0.70-2.24]). Kaplan-Meier \ncurves for death are shown in the Figure. Poisson regression indicated the hospitalization \nrate was significantly higher in the non-CKM group (IRR 1.98 [95% CI, 1.67-2.34]). \nIn the non-CKM group, hospitalizations were significantly more frequent in the severe-\nfrail group (OR 8.75 [95% CI, 1.36-56.3]).\nConclusions: In the older population, non-frail individuals often chose CKM. These \nfindings suggest the importance of considering clinical backgrounds when determining \nCKM indications.\nTH-OR44  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nCKD: Novel Risk Factors and Consequences\nANU-ADRI, BDSI, CAIDE, and LIBRA as Predictors of Mild Cognitive \nImpairment Dementia in CKD\nAmara Sarwal,1,2 Robert E. Boucher,1,2 Sydney E. Hartsell,1,2 Guo Wei,1,2 \nRavinder Singh,1,2 Niharika Katkam,1,2 Augustine Takyi,1,2 Akhil Ramanujam \nChakravartula,1,2 Farahnaz A. Moghaddam,1 Srinivasan Beddhu.1,2 \n1University of Utah Health, Salt Lake City, UT; 2VA Salt Lake City Health \nCare System, Salt Lake City, UT.\nBackground: The four commonly used risk prediction scores for dementia in the \ngeneral population include Australian National University Alzheimer’s Disease Risk \nIndex (ANU-ADRI), Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI), Cardiovascular Risk \nFactors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE), and LIfestyle for BRAin Health \n(LIBRA).

We compared \nvarious outcomes and conducted subgroup analyses based on the timing of endoscopy \nwithin the ACKD and ESKD cohorts.\nResults: The study included 2,163,929 patients. The incidence of GIB hospitalizations \nwas higher in the ACKD (3.2%) and ESKD (3.4%) groups compared to NCKD (2.2%). \nACKD and ESKD patients exhibited increased mortality (adjusted Odds Ratio 1.33 and \n1.94, respectively; p<0.001) compared to NCKD. Patients with ESKD demonstrated \nincreased rates of mechanical ventilation, pressor support, and blood transfusion, along \nwith prolonged and costly hospitalizations (p < 0.001 for all). There was decreased early \nendoscopic evaluation (<24 h) and increased late evaluations (> 48h) in the ACKD and \nESKD groups (p < 0.001 for all) compared to NCKD. Multivariate analysis revealed \nthat early endoscopy was significantly associated with decreased mortality while delayed \nendoscopy was significantly associated with increased mortality in ACKD and ESKD \npatients (p<=0.001 for all). The primary causes of GIB in both the ACKD and ESKD \ngroups were gastric/duodenal bleeding and angiodysplasia bleeding. ACKD and ESKD \nwere independent risk factors for angiodysplasia bleeding.\nConclusions: ACKD and ESKD are independent risk factors for GIB and in-\nhospital mortality. ESKD patients with GIB demonstrated significantly elevated rates \nof adverse outcomes compared to those without CKD. Both groups had a lower rate of \nearly endoscopy and a higher rate of delayed endoscopy, which emerged as independent \nrisk factors for mortality. Further investigation to understand the reasons for delayed \nendoscopic evaluations in ESKD patients is crucial for improving patient outcomes.\nTH-OR46  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nDiabetic Kidney Disease - Clinical: Novel Insights into Precision Medicine\nFinerenone in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and CKD by SGLT2 Inhibitor \nand Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists Receptor Agonist Use: \nA FIDELITY Analysis\nAjay K. Singh,1 Stefan D. Anker,2 Bertram Pitt,3 Peter Rossing,4,5 Luis M. \nRuilope,6,7 Christiane Ahlers,8 Youssef M. Farag,9,10 Marc Lambelet,11 \nMeike Daniela Brinker,12 Katja Rohwedder,13 Gerasimos Filippatos,14 \nGeorge L. Bakris.15 1Harvard Medical School, Renal Division, Brigham and \nWomen’s Hospital/Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; 2Department  \nof Cardiology (CVK) of German Heart Center Charité; German Centre  \nfor Cardiovascular Research (DZHK) partner site Berlin, Charité \nUniversitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany; 3Department of Medicine, University \nof Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI; 4Steno Diabetes Center \nCopenhagen, Herlev, Denmark; 5Department of Clinical Medicine, University \nof Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; 6Cardiorenal Translational Laboratory  \nand Hypertension Unit, Institute of Research imas12, Madrid, Spain; 7CIBER-CV,  \nHospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain; 8Statistics and Data \nInsights, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany; 9Postgraduate Medical Education, Harvard  \nMedical School, Boston, MA; 10Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins \nBloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD; 11Chrestos Concept \nGmbH & Co.

Here, we explored the treatment effect of finerenone in concomitant use with \nsodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) + glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor \nagonist (GLP-1RA).\nMethods: Patients in FIDELITY were on optimized renin–angiotensin system \ninhibition and randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo. Key outcomes in this analysis \nwere change in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) over time and treatment-\nemergent adverse events (including serum potassium [K+]).\nResults: Of 12,990 patients analyzed, 167 received concomitant use of finerenone \nwith SGLT-2i+GLP-1RA at baseline. Baseline characteristics were similar despite \nconcomitant use of finerenone with SGLT2i±GLP-1RA. Finerenone led to a greater \nreduction in UACR from baseline to month 4 vs placebo; at month 12, reduction was \n49%, 45%, 35% and 40% with concomitant use of finerenone with SGLT-2i+GLP-1RA,  \nGLP-1RA, SGLT-2i, and finerenone alone, respectively (Fig 1A). Safety profile of \nfinerenone was not modified by concomitant SGLT2i±GLP-1RA use. Overall, the risk \nof hyperkalemia leading to treatment discontinuation or hospitalization with finerenone \nwere low.

The endothelin-1 receptor antagonist \natrasentan reduces the risk of kidney failure in patients with diabetic kidney disease \n(DKD) in the phase 3 SONAR clinical trial. However, the individual patient’s response \nvaries. This study aimed to identify biomarkers predictive of atrasentan response and its \nunderlying molecular mechanisms.\nMethods: SOMAscan was used to discover urinary biomarkers associated with \natrasentan response in 180 patients from the SONAR trial. Logistic regression was used \nto identify markers whose change from baseline to 6 weeks of treatment are predictive to \nresponse. Top candidate markers were validated using ELISA. Biomarker concentration \nwas normalized by urine creatinine. Transcriptomic data from patients with DKD and \natrasentan-treated DKD mouse model were analyzed for mechanistic insight. The \ntop candidate biomarker was validated in the remaining SONAR cohort using a Cox \nproportional hazard regression model.\nResults: Putative biomarkers predictive of atrasentan response were identified. Of \nthese, urinary clusterin (uCLU) emerged as the top candidate and was further evaluated. \nKidney transcriptomic data revealed that CLU is upregulated in DKD in mice and \nhumans, and correlated with an endothelin activation score, generated from atrasentan-\ntreated BTBR ob/ob mice using DKD-associated endothelin 1 pathway genes that are \nreversely regulated by atrasentan. Higher uCLU at baseline is significantly associated \nwith an increased risk of a composite endpoint of kidney failure or 57% eGFR decline \n[HR1.09 (95% CI 1.03, 1.16; p=0.005)] in the SONAR clinical trial (N=3060). Atrasentan \nreduced uCLU during six weeks treatment by 42.6% and this early change in uCLU \nwas independently associated with a lower risk of the composite kidney endpoint after \nadjustment for all covariates [HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.84, 0.97); p=0.009].\nConclusions: Our study identified and validated uCLU as a promising \npharmacodynamic biomarker for assessing treatment response to atrasentan. This calls \nfor further clinical evaluation and implementation, and fosters indivdualized treatment \nthrough molecular stratification.\nFunding: NIDDK Support, Government Support - Non-U.S.\nTH-OR48  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nDiabetic Kidney Disease - Clinical: Novel Insights into Precision Medicine\nEphrin Signaling and the Development of Early Progressive Kidney \nFunction Decline\nZaipul Md Dom,1,2 Eiichiro Satake,1,2 Sok Cin Tye,1,2 Andrzej S. Krolewski.1,2 \n1Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA; 2Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.\nBackground: We were the first to report a novel role of Ephrin family members in \nthe progression of kidney failure in diabetes (Satake et al. JASN 2021). However, whether \nhigher Ephrin protein levels are associated with or causally related to the development of \nearly progressive kidney function decline (PKFD) is unknown.\nMethods: We assessed EPHA2 and EFNA4 protein levels using Joslin Olink \nproteomics platform among participants in the Joslin Kidney Study (JKS, n=1,269) and the \nChronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study (CRIC, n=1,170). We compared baseline levels of \nEPHA2 and EFNA4 across albuminuria categories with T1D and T2D and evaluated their \nassociations with kidney outcomes (kidney failure, eGFR slope and eGFR-based outcomes).\nResults: EPHA2 and EFNA4 levels increased progressively from non-diabetics to \nnormoalbuminuria (NA), microalbuminuria (MA), and proteinuria (PT) in both cohorts \n(Figure 1A). Significant variations were observed between T1D and T2D, and across \nall albuminuria categories with the highest levels observed in PT. T2D individuals \nconsistently had higher EPHA2 and EFNA4 levels compared to T1D. Both proteins showed \nsignificant negative correlations with eGFR, particularly pronounced in MA and PT. In \nthe CRIC cohort, EPHA2 and EFNA4 had significant positive correlations with UACR \nacross all albuminuria categories. Baseline EPHA2 levels were significantly associated \nwith kidney failure in models adjusted for HbA1c, eGFR and UACR (Figure 1B, JKS PT: \nHR [95%CI] =1.52 [1.21-1.91], p=0.00035, c-index=0.797); CRIC NA: HR [95%CI] =2.61 \n[1.05-6.19], p=0.029, c-index=0.789, adjusted for competing mortality).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that elevated levels of circulating EPHA2 and \nEFNA4 play a role in the initiation of early PKFD and can be used as predictors for the \ndevelopment of early PKFD.\nFunding: NIDDK Support\nTH-OR49  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nDiabetic Kidney Disease - Clinical: Novel Insights into Precision Medicine\nAdvancing KidneyIntelX Precision Medicine Platform in CKD\nSteven G. Coca,1 Sharon Stapleton,2 Katherine L. Edwards,2 Emily Cho Kiu Au,2 \nFergus Fleming,2 Girish N. Nadkarni.1 1Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, \nNew York, NY; 2Renalytix plc, London, United Kingdom.\nBackground: NBL1 and WFDC2 have been identified in experimental animals and \nomics-based platforms as markers of fibrosis in diabetic kidney disease and are associated \nwith progression to kidney failure. The kidneyintelX.dkd test is an FDA De Novo \nmarketing authorized test that currently incorporates measurement of three biomarkers via \nelectrochemiluminescence Meso Scale platform with clinical variables and categorizes \npatients at low, moderate, or high risk for progression of DKD. We aimed to advance the \ntranslation of NBL1 and WFDC2 for inclusion in future versions of the KidneyIntelX platform \nthrough clinical assay development and independent validation of prognostic performance.\nMethods: We established analytical characteristics using CLSI guidelines for two \nbiomarkers of kidney disease progression (NBL1, WFDC2). We measured plasma \nconcentrations at baseline in a replication cohort of 601 patients with DKD from the \nPenn Medicine Biobank (eGFR of 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m2 or eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 \nwith UACR ≥30 mg/g). The associations of baseline levels with a composite outcome of \n≥40% sustained decline in eGFR, or kidney failure (over 5 years) were evaluated using \nCox proportional hazard models.\nResults: Robust analytical parameters including repeatability were demonstrated \n(CV  ≤5.5% for NBL1 and CV ≤5.2% for WFDC2) over clinically relevant ranges. \nReference intervals at 95% confidence demonstrated discrimination between healthy \npopulations (476 to 3366 pg/mL for NBL1 and 1342 to 5880 pg/mL for WFDC2) and those \nwith diabetic kidney disease (807 to 20102 pg/mL for NBL1 and 2566 to 26538 pg/mL  \nfor WFDC2). The replication cohort had baseline median eGFR of 56 ml/min/1.73 m2 and \nmedian UACR of 57 mg/g with 92 (15.3%) composite events. The adjusted hazard ratio \nper SD increment of log2 baseline concentration for NBL1 was 1.6 (p<0.001) and was 2.5 \n(p<0.001) for WFDC2 after adjustment for UACR, eGFR and HbA1c.\nConclusions: NBL1 and WFDC2 assays demonstrated robust analytical performance \non transfer to the KidneyIntelX clinical laboratory platform. Both biomarkers were \nstrongly associated with the kidney outcome and therefore merit further investigation for \npotential incorporation into the KidneyIntelX precision medicine platform.\nFunding: Commercial Support - Renalytix AI Inc.\nTH-OR50  Oral Abstract  Thursday\nDiabetic Kidney Disease - Clinical: Novel Insights into Precision Medicine\nIdentification of Circulating Microbial DNA and Its Correlation in Patients \nwith Diabetic Kidney Disease\nHoang T. Linh, Norihiko Sakai, Miho Shimizu, Shinji Kitajima, Takashi Wada, \nYasunori Iwata. Kanazawa Daigaku, Kanazawa, Japan.\nBackground: In recent years, substantial studies have been accumulated to indicate the \nimportant role of gut microbiota in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The abnormal changes \nof bacterial-derived products could imply specific injuries or play beneficial or harmful \nroles in DKD progression. Our previous study reported a “leaky gut” was induced in mice \nwith DKD, leading to intestine-derived Klebsiella oxytoca translocation to circulation and \nkidneys then promoting DKD progression. However, the presence of K. oxytoca was not \ninvestigated in DKD patients. Therefore, the present study examines the K. oxytoca levels \nin circulation and their association with clinical characteristics in patients with DKD.",
  "5 patients with DKD needing hemodialysis (HD), and 7 patients with CKD without\ndiabetes, who were admitted to Kanazawa University Hospital in 2021. Bacterial-derived\nDNA (16S rDNA and a specific K. oxytoca gene) in the blood was detected using droplet\ndigital PCR, then investigated the relationship with clinical characteristics.\n**Results: The K. oxytoca gene was detected in all patient groups with rates of 64.7%**\nin patients with DKD without HD, 60% in DKD with HD group, and 42.9% in the\nnon-DKD CKD group, but only 1/11 (6.25%) in healthy participants. Patients with\nDKD (with or without HD) exhibited trends of higher levels of K. oxytoca copies and\n_K. oxytoca / 16S rDNA ratio compared to patients with non-DKD CKD. Interestingly,_\nblood _K. oxytoca copies and_ _K.oxytoca/_ _16S rDNA ratio have been identified to have_\na positive correlation with blood creatinine (r=0.7007 and 0.6492) or BUN levels\n(r=0.582 and 0.5619) in DKD patients. Considering eGFR, negative correlations were\nobserved with both K. oxytoca copies and the K.oxytoca/16S rDNA ratio, with correlation\ncoefficients of -0.4509 and -0.4664, respectively. Moreover, there was a correlation\nbetween K. oxytoca gene copies and higher neutrophil percentages (r=0.4816), along with\na lower lymphocyte frequency (r=-0.5558), and elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio\n(r=0.4998).\n**Conclusions: The presence of the K. oxytoca gene in the circulation could serve as a**\nbiomarker reflecting reduced renal function and chronic inflammation in DKD patients.\n**Funding: Government Support - Non-U.S.**\n\n###### TH-OR51 Oral Abstract Thursday\nDiabetic Kidney Disease - Clinical: Novel Insights into Precision Medicine\n###### Autophagy-Related Gene Expression in Diabetes and CKD Christine P.

This association was consistent across baseline\neGFR and UACR subgroups. The uEGF/Cr change from baseline to year 1 was -12.5%\n([95% CI -15.6, -9.1]; p<0.001) in the placebo group and -5.4% ([95% CI -8.7, -1.9];\np=0.002) in the canagliflozin group, corresponding to a between-group difference of 8.1%\n([95% CI 1.1, 15.6]; p=0.016).
